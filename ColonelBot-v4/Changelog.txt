ColonelBot v4.0 
===================

**Feature Overview**
This version of ColonelBot is retargeting .NET Core 2.1 designed to be more portable and runnable on 
more reliable hardware, such as microcomputers running Linux.  

This rewrite also aims to fix the bad practices of the previous versions in an effort to maintain
a cleaner style for easier future work.

**New Features**
- !hostflip: Determines who should host based on essentially a coin flip.  (ADD A CALLBACK TO WHO REQUESTED IT)
- !lookup <Game> <Chip or Code>: This feature now contains chips from MMBN1 through 6. If a user simply
does !lookup 5 S, the command will look up the chip codes without the need for the /code/ suffix. If the
user doesn't specify a game, the command will default to MMBN6.
- !deckmaster: Toggles the Deckmaster role - a pingable role used for matchmaking for the MM NT Warrior TCG.

**Changed Features**
- !quote: This system has been revamped to move to JSON rather than the former NoSQL solution.  Quote Adding
and removal is now re-enabled. Thank you for your patience while we worked on identifying a proper solution for 
this essential community feature.
- !help: The !help articles have been rewritten to be clearer and provide more information.  The normal !help
command has been formatted to be more readable as well.  
- !event <>: The event tools have been rewritten to be a bit more stable and rely on JSON following the removal of
NoSQL.  This will allow organizers to rest easier that their entries and information is safer and handles drops 
and joins more gracefully.   
!event info: A Rule Set field has been added. A Schedule field has also been added. A Character Limit has been 
imposed on the event description in order to keep the output from ColonelBot manageable.

**Behind-The-Scenes**
- A lot of redundant code has been cleaned up.  The ATB Module and Help Module have been rewritten.  
- The Community Calendar module has been removed.
- The Twitch Module has been removed.
- The Macros Module has been removed - It was intended for quote migration but never used.
- ModeratorModule has been renamed to DeleteModule.
- The CommandService has been rewritten.
- The Logging Service has been rewritten.
- A ServerGuardService has been added that performs sanitization and raid mitigation actively and asynchronously.
- Models have been implemented for clean JSON integration. 
- The Quotes Module has been shifted to JSON as stated in Changed Features which will allow greater control over 
sanitizing the quotes for an HTTP List function similar to the one that was in early v3.  If the HTTP generation 
system proves problematic, it will simply be removed.
